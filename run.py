# Initialization: initialize model of required type and set up mean
# state.  Given here are five examples, the latter three described in
# Callies, Flierl, Ferrari, Fox-Kemper (2015).  These are low-
# resolution versions of the simulations in the paper.  For the floating
# Eady and two-Eady case, the resolution is insufficient to resolve the
# instabilities properly.  These low-resolution models can be used to
# spin up higher-resolution versions (see below).  The time step chosen
# here may be too large for the fully turbulent regime.  The model can
# be restarted with a reduced time step when it blows up (see below).

# Set up the numerics: Here we initialize the numerics, specifying
# domain size, resolution and time step.  Note that initnum must always
# be called after initmean has been used to set up the mean state and
# model parameters, because these are used in setting up the inversion.
# We also define the hyper- and hypoviscosity.  In this case, high-order
# hyperviscosity is used, with a coefficient that is modified from
# Callies et al. (2015) to account for the the reduced resolution.

# lates the current state onto the finer grid.  We also reduce the

# Step model forward: This is the main loop of the model.  It steps
# forward the model, prints information on the model state, and episo-
# dically saves the model state to file and a snapshot as a png-file.
